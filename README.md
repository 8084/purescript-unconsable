# purescript-unconsable

Type class for data structures which can be `uncons`ed + some utilities built on top of it.

Made as an attempt to generalize some code for various data structures I was working on. Too bad I didn't discover profunctor optics back then. Most likely you don't want to use this library. You should be able to express "unconsability" using [Prisms](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-profunctor-lenses/6.2.0/docs/Data.Lens.Types#t:Prism).
